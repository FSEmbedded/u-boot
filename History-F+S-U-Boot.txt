History of Changes for U-Boot on PicoMOD6/PicoCOM3
--------------------------------------------------

V1.2 (in progress)
------------------
- Add support for PicoCOM3
- Fix display power-on/power-off sequence


V1.1 (07.06.2011)
-----------------
- New MMC driver for MMC/SD-Cards, supports external SD-Slot (mmc 0)
  and on-board Micro-SD-Slot (mmc 1); use after mmcinit
- New environment variables autoload, autoaddr, autommc and autousb to
  allow automatic start of an autoscript file from SD-Card or USB
  stick; this can be used to automatically install software and is
  therefore enabled by default (clear variables if not wanted)
- New command line parser to allow quoting with "..." and '...'; this
  also keeps several words grouped as one argument
- New LCD driver with up to five overlay windows with arbitrary size,
  position; support for alpha blending and color keying and 14
  different pixel formats (1, 2, 4, 8 bpp with color map, and up to 28
  bits per pixel RGBA-8884 truecolor)
- New command "lcd" to set and show all display parameters
- New command "win" to set and show all window parameters
- List of predefined LCD panels (rather short now, but will be
  expanded in the future)
- New command "cmap" to handle color maps
- New command "fbpool" to handle the framebuffers of the windows
- New commands "draw" and "adraw" to draw pixels, lines, frames, filled
  rectangles, circles, filled discs, turtle polygons, text, bitmaps
  and four different test images; draw simply stores the alpha value
  to the window, adraw directly applys alpha to the current window
  content.
- Support for BMP and PNG bitmaps; bitmaps can be grouped to
  "multi-bitmaps" and each individual bitmap can be accessed; bitmaps
  can be drawn with double width and/or double height
- Text can have attributes bold, inverse, underline, strike-through,
  double width, double height and transparent; however only one font
  with 8x16 pixels is available
- New command "bminfo" to list infos of the bitmaps in a multi-bitmap
- New automatically generated environment variables "lcd" and "win0"
  to "win4" holding the current LCD and window configuration. These
  can be used to permanently store the display settings.
- New environment variable "splashcmd" that is executed after
  initalizing the display, e.g. to show a splash screen (boot logo)
- Improved console devices to support different consoles; e.g. there
  can be a console on each LCD window
- Console settings (stdin, stdout, stderr) can be stored in the
  environment; useful if the console should not appear on the LCD
- Using the MMU now; however the data cache is not enabled by default
  as the USB driver will not work then; you can say "dcache on" to
  enable the data cache manually
- Support for FAT media without partition table; handle FAT16 root
  directory correctly
- Timing is now correct (was way too fast); this also improves USB
  stick recognition
- New highly optimized memory functions in assembler (memcpy, memmove,
  memset, memset32)
- Compiler now optimizes code for ARMv6 (ARM11)
- Several small fixes, no compiler warnings anymore
- Several fixes to reduce memory footprint
- Removed some unnecessary debug messages
- Removed serial download (loadb and loads); this was necessary to
  keep the U-Boot binary size below 256KB.



V1.0 (18.10.2010)
-----------------
- Added support for USB host (USB hubs and mass storage devices)
- Added support for FAT filesystems (ported back from u-boot-2010.09
  and enhanced)
- Changed spare area layout to match the layout of NBoot, added ECC-8
  support for NBoot region
- Access to NBoot and U-Boot regions now actually works
- Added new default partitions NBoot, UBoot and UBootEnv; this moves
  the TargetFS to /dev/mtdblock5 in Linux
- Increased Kernel partition from 2MB to 3MB
- Added software protection for NBoot partition to avoid accidental
  erasing, e.g. when calling "nand erase" without further parameters:
    nand nboot [protect | unprotect]
- Placed environment fix in NAND, removed support for MoviNand and
  OneNand (not required on PicoMOD6); this reduced the image size
  considerably
- Reduced environment to 16KB; this allows for a bad block
- Added support for sntp command (time synching with time server)
- Removed command "reginfo" as it only produces empty output on ARM
- Aligned strings when calling "help"
- Added new environment variables for easy switching between NFS and
  local boot and for testing kernels:
    run bootnfs   --> switch to NFS boot (TargetFS mounted via NFS)
    run bootlocal --> switch to local boot (TargetFS loaded from NAND)
    run r         --> download & start kernel without storing to NAND
- Added target "make uboot.nb0" to create image file that is padded to
  256KB (required for NBoot); this target is also automatically built
  when calling "make" without any arguments
- Removed some debug strings that accidently slipped into the previus
  releases


V0.2 (05.02.2010)
-----------------
- Activate ethernet once to set MAC address


V0.1 (22.01.2010)
-----------------
- First working version
- Update of U-Boot only possible from NBoot
