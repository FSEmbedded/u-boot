History of Changes for U-Boot on PicoMOD6/PicoCOM3/armStoneA8
-------------------------------------------------------------

armStoneA8 V1.0 (13.04.2012, based on u-boot-2011.12)
-----------------------------------------------------
This is an interim release targeted to armStoneA8 only (PicoMOD6 and
PicoCOM3 won't work). It is based on V1.2 with many improvements
already in place, but many of these features are not yet complete.
They will be mentioned in the next regular release.

- Rebase to u-boot-2011.12
- Enable NE2000 ethernet driver to use CONFIG_NET_MULTI; improve DP_*
  macros to support S5P
- Add delay after powering USB root hub to detect USB storage devices
  more reliably 
- Make size of uboot.nb0 configurable by platform configuration header
  file; on armStoneA8, the size of uboot.nb0 is 384K
- Add drivers/mtd/nand/s5p_nand.c to support NAND on S5P
- Add drivers/usb/host/{ehci,ohci}-s5p.c to support EHCI and OHCI USB
  drivers on S5P 
- Add drivers/rtc/s5p_rtc.c to support real time clock on S5P
- New timer module arch/arm/cpu/armv7/s5p-common/timer.c that counts
  from 0xffffffff down; is simpler, creates less code
- Fix timing computation in drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c and net/net.c
  that silently assumed a timer tick time of 1ms
- Extended info in arc/arm/cpu/armv7/s5p-common/cpu_info.c;
  arch_cpu_init() must not use variables, store in global data instead
- Improve definition of registers, cpu detection, gpio pin numbers,
  include files to better support S5P
- Add check for deleted long dir entries in fs/fat/fat.c
- Make autoload_script() work with CONFIG_GENERIC_MMC; however this
  feature will be reworked and is disabled by default in this version
- Use mach=armv6 instead mach=armv5 as in default u-boot
- New stdio_dev system to support LCD output better; change serial
  lines to support this
- LCD configuration and output is heavily reworked; however it is not
  yet complete and therefore disabled in this version
- Support armStoneA8, NetDCU14 (and EASYsom1) in one binary: detect
  board type and RAM size at runtime, set prompt string, RAM base
  and default loadaddr accordingly
- Make loading functions load at address given in environment variable
  loadaddr, not at fix address CONFIG_SYS_LOAD_ADDR
- Support UBI and UBIFS, activate appropriate commands


V1.2 (05.09.2011)
------------------
- Add support for PicoCOM3
- Fix display power-on/power-off sequence
- Fix display buffer enable signal (BUF_ENA)
- Fix "lcd ponseq" and "lcd poffseq" commands
- Optimize udelay() function
- Remove some unneeded code


V1.1 (07.06.2011)
-----------------
- New MMC driver for MMC/SD-Cards, supports external SD-Slot (mmc 0)
  and on-board Micro-SD-Slot (mmc 1); use after mmcinit
- New environment variables autoload, autoaddr, autommc and autousb to
  allow automatic start of an autoscript file from SD-Card or USB
  stick; this can be used to automatically install software and is
  therefore enabled by default (clear variables if not wanted)
- New command line parser to allow quoting with "..." and '...'; this
  also keeps several words grouped as one argument
- New LCD driver with up to five overlay windows with arbitrary size,
  position; support for alpha blending and color keying and 14
  different pixel formats (1, 2, 4, 8 bpp with color map, and up to 28
  bits per pixel RGBA-8884 truecolor)
- New command "lcd" to set and show all display parameters
- New command "win" to set and show all window parameters
- List of predefined LCD panels (rather short now, but will be
  expanded in the future)
- New command "cmap" to handle color maps
- New command "fbpool" to handle the framebuffers of the windows
- New commands "draw" and "adraw" to draw pixels, lines, frames, filled
  rectangles, circles, filled discs, turtle polygons, text, bitmaps
  and four different test images; draw simply stores the alpha value
  to the window, adraw directly applys alpha to the current window
  content.
- Support for BMP and PNG bitmaps; bitmaps can be grouped to
  "multi-bitmaps" and each individual bitmap can be accessed; bitmaps
  can be drawn with double width and/or double height
- Text can have attributes bold, inverse, underline, strike-through,
  double width, double height and transparent; however only one font
  with 8x16 pixels is available
- New command "bminfo" to list infos of the bitmaps in a multi-bitmap
- New automatically generated environment variables "lcd" and "win0"
  to "win4" holding the current LCD and window configuration. These
  can be used to permanently store the display settings.
- New environment variable "splashcmd" that is executed after
  initalizing the display, e.g. to show a splash screen (boot logo)
- Improved console devices to support different consoles; e.g. there
  can be a console on each LCD window
- Console settings (stdin, stdout, stderr) can be stored in the
  environment; useful if the console should not appear on the LCD
- Using the MMU now; however the data cache is not enabled by default
  as the USB driver will not work then; you can say "dcache on" to
  enable the data cache manually
- Support for FAT media without partition table; handle FAT16 root
  directory correctly
- Timing is now correct (was way too fast); this also improves USB
  stick recognition
- New highly optimized memory functions in assembler (memcpy, memmove,
  memset, memset32)
- Compiler now optimizes code for ARMv6 (ARM11)
- Several small fixes, no compiler warnings anymore
- Several fixes to reduce memory footprint
- Removed some unnecessary debug messages
- Removed serial download (loadb and loads); this was necessary to
  keep the U-Boot binary size below 256KB.



V1.0 (18.10.2010)
-----------------
- Added support for USB host (USB hubs and mass storage devices)
- Added support for FAT filesystems (ported back from u-boot-2010.09
  and enhanced)
- Changed spare area layout to match the layout of NBoot, added ECC-8
  support for NBoot region
- Access to NBoot and U-Boot regions now actually works
- Added new default partitions NBoot, UBoot and UBootEnv; this moves
  the TargetFS to /dev/mtdblock5 in Linux
- Increased Kernel partition from 2MB to 3MB
- Added software protection for NBoot partition to avoid accidental
  erasing, e.g. when calling "nand erase" without further parameters:
    nand nboot [protect | unprotect]
- Placed environment fix in NAND, removed support for MoviNand and
  OneNand (not required on PicoMOD6); this reduced the image size
  considerably
- Reduced environment to 16KB; this allows for a bad block
- Added support for sntp command (time synching with time server)
- Removed command "reginfo" as it only produces empty output on ARM
- Aligned strings when calling "help"
- Added new environment variables for easy switching between NFS and
  local boot and for testing kernels:
    run bootnfs   --> switch to NFS boot (TargetFS mounted via NFS)
    run bootlocal --> switch to local boot (TargetFS loaded from NAND)
    run r         --> download & start kernel without storing to NAND
- Added target "make uboot.nb0" to create image file that is padded to
  256KB (required for NBoot); this target is also automatically built
  when calling "make" without any arguments
- Removed some debug strings that accidently slipped into the previus
  releases


V0.2 (05.02.2010)
-----------------
- Activate ethernet once to set MAC address


V0.1 (22.01.2010)
-----------------
- First working version
- Update of U-Boot only possible from NBoot
