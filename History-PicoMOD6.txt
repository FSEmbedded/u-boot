History of Changes for U-Boot on PicoMOD6
-----------------------------------------

V1.0 (18.10.2010)
-----------------
- Added support for USB host (USB hubs and mass storage devices)
- Added support for FAT filesystems (ported back from u-boot-2010.09
  and enhanced)
- Changed spare area layout to match the layout of NBoot, added ECC-8
  support for NBoot region
- Access to NBoot and U-Boot regions now actually works
- Added new default partitions NBoot, UBoot and UBootEnv; this moves
  the TargetFS to /dev/mtdblock5 in Linux
- Increased Kernel partition from 2MB to 3MB
- Added software protection for NBoot partition to avoid accidental
  erasing, e.g. when calling "nand erase" without further parameters:
    nand nboot [protect | unprotect]
- Placed environment fix in NAND, removed support for MoviNand and
  OneNand (not required on PicoMOD6); this reduced the image size
  considerably
- Reduced environment to 16KB; this allows for a bad block
- Added support for sntp command (time synching with time server)
- Removed command "reginfo" as it only produces empty output on ARM
- Aligned strings when calling "help"
- Added new environment variables for easy switching between NFS and
  local boot and for testing kernels:
    run bootnfs   --> switch to NFS boot (TargetFS mounted via NFS)
    run bootlocal --> switch to local boot (TargetFS loaded from NAND)
    run r         --> download & start kernel without storing to NAND
- Added target "make uboot.nb0" to create image file that is padded to
  256KB (required for NBoot); this target is also automatically built
  when calling "make" without any arguments
- Removed some debug strings that accidently slipped into the previus
  releases


V0.2 (05.02.2010)
-----------------
- Activate ethernet once to set MAC address


V0.1 (22.01.2010)
-----------------
- First working version
- Update of U-Boot only possible from NBoot
